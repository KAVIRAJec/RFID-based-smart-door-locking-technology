# RFID-based-smart-door-locking-technology

- RFID based attendance monitoring system is a system that uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to record attendance of individuals. The system consists of an RFID reader, an Arduino microcontroller(I used Atmega chip to reduce size and increase functionality), a PCB board, and a database management system.

- The RFID reader reads the unique identification number of the RFID tag attached to the person and sends it to the atmega microcontroller. The Arduino processes this information and sends it to the database management system.RFID emits high-frequency waves. When triggered by an electromagnetic pulse from a nearby reader, the tag will transmit data back to the reader.

- The PCB board serves as a platform for connecting and mounting the components of the system, including the RFID reader, Arduino, and other supporting components such as power supplies, LEDs, and resistors.

## Technology Used
Designing an RFID based attendance monitoring system using Arduino and PCB design requires knowledge of electronics, microcontrollers, programming, and PCB designing.

## Benefit
The attendance monitoring system can be used in schools, universities, offices, and other institutions where attendance records are essential. The advantages of this system include accurate attendance recording, reduction of manual errors, and reduction in administrative workload.This project can also used to design and develop an RFID-based door lock system for smart homes. This project is very suitable for Door lock systems and anti-theft networks. Each card has a unique ID, and when a card is brought close to the sensor, The LED will turn on, and a message that the lock has been unlocked will be displayed on the LCD for that unique ID. This will enable the stepper motor to unlock the latch or contraption. Atmega328p IC is the core element above that all the peripherals are integrated and designed as a single PCB
