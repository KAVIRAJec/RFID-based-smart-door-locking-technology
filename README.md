# RFID-based-smart-door-locking-technology


RFID emits high-frequency waves. When triggered by an electromagnetic pulse from a nearby reader, the tag will transmit data back to the reader. This project aims to design and develop an RFID-based door lock system for smart homes. This project is very suitable for Door lock systems and anti-theft networks. Each card has a unique ID, and when a card is brought close to the sensor, The LED will turn on, and a message that the lock has been unlocked will be displayed on the LCD for that unique ID. This will enable the stepper motor to unlock the latch or contraption. Atmega328p IC is the core element above that all the peripherals are integrated and designed as a single PCB
